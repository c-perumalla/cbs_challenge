# Data 
This exercise involves a public dataset from Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/yingwurenjian/chicago-divvy-bicycle-sharing-data 
describing rides in a bike share program in Chicago over many years.

# Challenge
Determine the effect of temperature on bike trip counts and lengths, controlling for any relevant seasonality
(at the most relevant timescales - use your judgement!) and customer segments. 
Make your case with the appropriate visualizations.

# Stages
## Exploration stage
1. Explored subscriber, commuter trips. 
2. Explored effect of season on number of trips
3. Explored effect of temperature on number of trips
4. Explored effect of temperature on length of trips
5. Explored effect of events on length of trips

## synthesis stage 
1. Linear/Non linear models to evaluate number of trips on a given day with certain mean temperature
2. Suggested two other methods 1. Estimated the probabability of taking a trip for a given temperature using normal approximation 2. Using bayes theory
